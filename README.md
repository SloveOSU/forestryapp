## Description
Owning forested land comes with many responsibilities. With the ever growing issue of climate change and natural health threats one may easily get overwhelmed. Fortunately for landowners there are forestry and conservation professionals that can aid with this process. The professionals survey the forested lands in question and advise the landowners of any health issues they have diagnosed. They can suggest a course of action which the landowners are free to take or reject.

Our team will build the Forest Wellness Checkup Application (FWCA) for The Oregon State University (OSU) Extension Service in order to help the above professionals during their surveys. Under the guidance of OSU Extension Professors Fitzgerald, Punches, and Ahrens we will develop a checklist that the professionals can use on their tablets when inspecting the forests.
